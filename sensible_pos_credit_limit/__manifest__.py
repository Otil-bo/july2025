        Credit Limit for Customers
            You can define a credit limit for each customer directly from their contact record in Odoo.
            This credit limit restricts the total amount a customer can charge at the POS, ensuring they do not exceed the agreed-upon amount.
        POS Validation
            When processing transactions in the POS interface, the system checks if the customer has exceeded their credit limit.
            If the customer tries to make a purchase that exceeds the available credit, a warning or blocking message is displayed, preventing the sale from going through.
